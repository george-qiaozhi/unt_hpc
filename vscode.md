# How to sync your Visual Studio Code to your project on Talon

## Follow the website installation guidlines [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## In order to sync your VS code to Talon we will use the official guide found [here](Remote Development using SSH):

Installation
To get started, you need to:

* 1. Install an [OpenSSH compatible SSH client](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client) if one is not already present.
* 1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
* 1. Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension). [Where a lot of poeple would start if you already have VS Code installed and your computer can handle ssh to Talon]

To Install Remote Development extension:

* Press ** Ctrl + Shift + x** to enter into the EXTENSIONS: Marketplace.
* Type ** Remote Development** in the search bar.
* It should be the first option. Click on it and hit ** Install**
* You should see a small green rectangular icon on your window in the bottom left corner
